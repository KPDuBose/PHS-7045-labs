# Overview
This week will focus on using devtools to build some R packages. This first part will deal with the basics of development.

# Packages we will be using today
1) *devtools*: package development tools for R
2) *roxygen2*
3) others haha

# Benefits of writing an R package
Easy to share code and look at. It's also already standardized. Makes things reproducible and letting people be able to site your work. 
This also makes it so that your method that you're writing isn't going to die either.
CRAN also double checks your code and that it is written correctly.
